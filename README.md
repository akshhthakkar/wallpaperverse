## 👨‍💻 Not Just Another Repo...

Hi, I'm **Aksh**! 👋 As a massive wallpaper enthusiast, I've spent hours curating, organizing, and building this space. I believe a desktop background isn't just an image—it's a vibe, a mood, a statement.

I gave up on ad-cluttered wallpaper sites and built **WallpaperVerse**: a premium, ad-free, high-performance gallery for the highest quality wallpapers from my favorite universes.

## 🚀 Features

This isn't just a static HTML page. It's a highly optimized web application built for performance and experience.
